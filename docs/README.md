# Twitter Home Mixer Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive, human-readable explanation of the Twitter Home Mixer algorithm source code. The documentation is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical readers while maintaining technical accuracy.

## What is Twitter Home Mixer?

Twitter Home Mixer is the core service responsible for constructing and serving Twitter's Home Timelines. It powers three main feed types:

1. **For You** - Best tweets from people you follow + recommended out-of-network content
2. **Following** - Reverse chronological tweets from people you follow
3. **Lists** - Reverse chronological tweets from list members

The system is built on Product Mixer, Twitter's custom Scala framework for building content feeds.
